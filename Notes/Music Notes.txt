Ambient background music, around 5 tracks at about 3 or 4 minutes each, with a 'calm' and 'battle' version of each.

Style of switching between calm + battle version is notable in the youtube playlist for the FTL soundtrack (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFSHrnqQyV4&list=PLDWrj6ynqDMGiREzFXF_JkuwBi3-pUKJH)


"Civil" is probably the closest example to what would fit best with our game, light and peaceful for the 'calm' version (what FTL calls 'Explore') and much more upbeat and intense for the 'battle' version.

All of the music for FTL is good though, so feel free to take inspiration from any of the tracks in that playlist
